#Speech Recognition

I've  worked on the project titled Speech Recognition. The project was aimed to analyse and understand the various ways to find speech disfluencies in software application. As part of the project, I've mainly worked on:

1. Creating algorithms for detecting disfluencies in audio files.
2. Studying and comparing the performance of different detection algorithms.
3. Researching and experimenting on key audio parameters using analytical and graphical methods

My other works includes reading and understanding the business requirements,
reading research papers, documenting the work. where I've learnt about audio, tone, text, speech to text, text to speech APIs provided by AWS and google.
